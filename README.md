This is code for an infection simulator.

Runs only in console, however I may work on making it graphical.


# Running

To run this on windows, download the .exe file and then run it.

To run this on linux, download the .py code then in the terminal type: `python3 Infection_SourceCode.py`

For mac ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
