# Infection-Simulator

This code if for an infection simulator.
Runs only in console, however I may work on making it graphical.

In Infection_Settings.txt, it must be written as:

X=25
Y=25

The max (that looks good) is X=210 Y=45

Things that will be added:

Cells becoming uninfected. - working on.
Cells being immune.
