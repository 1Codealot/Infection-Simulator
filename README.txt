For Infection_Settings there are important things to know:

1. No spaces Between variable name and equals sign and no space between equals sign and value.
(Example: Setting=12)
2. For the X and Y values, the most of the screen (for me) it can take up is X=210 Y=45 but you will have to fullscreen it and scroll up a bit.
3. For Healing, if you want it to be on (which it is on default) it must be 1 (Healing=1) because it wouldn't work as a string (like Healing =True). If you want to turn it off, put any integer (otherwise it'll crash).
